  <h3 align="center">DigiDestined DB Project</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is meant to crowd source database entries and edits from the community for the DigiDestined Discord bot. As we move forward, we need more and more data for more and more Digimon, which is to much for 1 or 2 people to handle alone in a short amount of time. To speed up this process I have put the most up to date databases the bot uses for both Digimon and their moves. You will be able to download the database and edit/add entries to them, then submit the changes with a pull request. All pull requests will be reviewed and, if the changes are approved, they will be added to the bot with credit, and the databases will be updated in this repository for future pulls.
